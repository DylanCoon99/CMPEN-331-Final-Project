# CMPEN-331-Final-Project
Complete implementation of 5 stage MIPS CPU Pipeline

This is a verilog implementation of a 5 stage MIPS Pipelined CPU. The five stages are
fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write back. This implementation can handle most 
MIPS instructions with an exception of jump and branch instructions.
